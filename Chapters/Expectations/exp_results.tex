\section{Expected Outcome}
It is expected that the successful conclusion of the project will yield three mathematical expressions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \gls{BER} for \gls{OFDM} in an \gls{AWGN} channel.
	\item \gls{BER} for \gls{OFDM} in an Rayleigh Fading channel.
	\item \gls{BER} for \gls{OFDM} in an Rician Fading channel.
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, there will be a simulation model for the evaluation of \gls{PAPR} performance of an \gls{OFDM} communication system.
