\section{Problem Justification}
Through  development of a mathematical model for \gls{OFDM}  with a fading channel, anyone designing a system can be able to perform an analysis of the system with much ease and simplicity without having to use of a computational software. The mathematical model can also be integrated into a simulation software with much ease than before with less requirements put forth. An implementer of the said \gls{OFDM} variant can be able to easily evaluate the performance of their systems without having to put much thought to it.
