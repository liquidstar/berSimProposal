\section{Background Information}
In digital communication, information is expressed as bits which are grouped into \gls{symbol}s. Symbol period must be greater than delay time so as to avoid \gls{ISI}. As data rate is inversely proportional to symbol period, longer symbol periods translate to low data rates and diminished communication efficiency. In an \gls{SCM} system, a critical balance between symbol period and data rate must be found. The designer must compromise data rate to mitigate against \gls{ISI}.

In an \gls{MCM} communication system, however, the total available bandwidth is divided into sub-bands over which multiple carriers can transmit in parallel. Closer placement of said sub-carriers in the spectrum facilitates achievement of an overall high data rate. Nevertheless, \gls{ICI} will occur when the spacing between subsequent carriers is too small. In \gls{FDM}, guard bands are placed between adjacent carriers, resulting in lower spectral efficiency and consequent reduced data rate.

\gls{OFDM} is an \gls{MCM} scheme that solves both the \gls{ISI} problem pertinent to \gls{SCM} and the \gls{ICI} problem inherent to \gls{MCM}. \gls{OFDM} uses a large number of low data rate carriers to accomplish a composite high data rate communication system. \gls{orthogonal}ity allows carrier overlap without \gls{ICI}. As each carrier has a low data rate, \gls{ISI} is greatly diminished.

Adoption of \gls{OFDM} in mainstream communication took hold in the 21st century while the technology had already been patented in the 60s. Interest was strong but implementation techniques were costly. However, with software implementation of \gls{FFT} and \gls{IFFT} algorithms, large scale implementation became viable and is now the preferred modulation technique in a world limited to a set spectrum budget.

\gls{OFDM} \gls{symbol}s are generated based on the modulation technique used, for instance \gls{MPSK} and \gls{QAM} by modulating a carrier.
